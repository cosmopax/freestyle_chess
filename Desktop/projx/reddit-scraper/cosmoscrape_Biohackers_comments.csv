In the last 7 years or so, my competition days are dwindling and I just do things for fun or recreationally but I hit the gym 5-6 days a week and focus on the big 4 with some accessory work and keep very strong. I have found that not switching up my programming caused me to reach the point of overeaching often and hit over training a couple of times requiring multiple weeks of recovery. So, now I make a concerted effort to stay on my programs, but switch up every 6-8 weeks with a full deload in-between where I will only do LISS and some very light accessory work, get a lot of rest, and eat a lot.

If you manage your stress, sleep on a strict schedule and feed your body adequately, you will never get overtraining symptoms.

I experienced this on myself. I used to get into overtraining at much lower volumes I have now. I train over 11h per week, a mix of heavy lifting, running and cycling.

n6b0jh4,1mehowk,mathestnoobest,"listen to your body and adjust. don't blindly follow what ""the science"" tells you is the optimal way to train. training/fitness science is mostly garbage but besides that, the guidelines are derived from averages. they don't necessarily apply to you as an individual. they're only useful as a starting point and you fine tune from there. you need to constantly run a n=1 experiment and adjust as you go. only thing i can recommend is change 1 variable at a time, or you won't be able to isolate what works. 

but don't regard the bro-science or even the ""proper"" science as gospel; they are just general guidelines, starting points to experiment from. what's optimal for the ""average man"" is not necessarily optimal *for you*. 

plus, what's optimal for hypertrophy or athletic performance (say) is not necessarily optimal for the health of your joints and body in general.

n6ejwzy,1mehowk,seztomabel,"There's no reason to be eating low carb, even if you're completely sedentary.",1,2025-08-01 21:25:50
n6exyaj,1mehowk,StatzGee,"Yep, you got it. This is especially true if you have genetics that just don't handle stress well, have a lot of stressors in your life like career, family. 

You can only build what you can recover from. If you can only recover from two hard strength days per week that is actually optimal for you regardless of what any studies say. 

I would look up Joel Jamieson. Also, you're in the biohacking sub, do you have any sort of HRV tracking device? This is why things like the oura ring are so helpful. It really helps you modulate your intensity and recovery because if your HRV is consistently going down, you know you are under recovering. If it's staying the same or improving, you are improving fitness. The case that Joel makes is that building an aerobic base is key to being able to handle more intensity because your aerobic system is developed enough and recovery is an aerobic driven process. It doesn't mean you have to be an endurance athlete, and what's nice about it is that the type of aerobic work that builds the base feels great and can actually do the opposite to your system where it enhances recovery rather than detracts. And when I say builds recovery, I mean in all aspects such as a stressful day at work or a super hard set of squats. I say all of this because there is the possibility that you can actually build the capacity to handle more stress,  but that it has to be developed through low intensity exercise not high intensity as everybody else recommends. But you can also do what you have experienced and simply do less! I'm trying to personally build more capacity because the way my lifestyle is right now, I'm absolutely obsessed with pickleball (and have been in love with lifting heavy for 25 years) and it's not for exercise purposes it's just that I find it absolutely so fun and I don't go out and party or drink anymore, so it's been a fantastic addition to my life. But when you start playing at a high level, it does require recovery when you play for several hours several times a week. 

Sometimes we just need to stare at some trees sitting in a park thinking of nothing and doing nothing. It's honestly part of our natural state.",1,2025-08-01 22:35:43

n69sea5,1mehowk,Azzmo,"Modernity has conditioned us to think it normal to aspire to be *very different* than a normal human, for various reasons (some of which include politics). There are so many people in the social sphere, now with social media, that you have to look like a roided freak of nature to stand out (or even feel sufficient).

This leads to people trying to find success in the extremes. But our ancestors evolved without these extreme levels of hypertrophy, excess hormones, excess stress (except in rare times of tragedy), excess fiction, excessive relationships, excessive attention paid to things we cannot control, etc. So many things about modernity are unnatural. 

To find happiness and contentment and fitness I think we need to look 10,000+ years (pre-agriculture) backward in most ways. In the fitness context, I'm sure that we're well designed for carrying 20-50 pounds on our backs for longish distances. We're designed to climb and pull our body weight up.

Cutting carbs might help you manage weight loss and appetite in the short term, but in the long run it's detrimental. If you can't manage appetite and weight with whole food carbs like you mentioned, there is an issue with your metabolism. Avoiding those carbs is only going to contribute to that in the long run.

n6f0wwb,1mehowk,StatzGee,"If you want the greatest body composition of your life, which happens as a result of optimizing your hormones, then you want a moderate dose of carbs. Carbs help thyroid convert from inactive to active so that's T4 to T3, and they also decrease sex hormone binding globulin and decrease cortisol which means you have higher testosterone. If you're not familiar with carb cycling, that's pretty much the perfect diet especially with someone like you where you are modulating intensity throughout the week. You eat higher carb on days that require more glycogen, so that's days that you would lift or sprint or play anaerobic sports. And on the days that you are doing lower intensity activity which is more aerobic based and using oxygen, then you need less carbohydrates. It's a great way to slowly ""main gain"".  something to be aware of, is when we are fasting or we are low carb and you feel that "" energy "",  that can be from an increase in cortisol. I would actually go as far to say that carbs are equivalent to your rest days. What I mean is, the epiphany you had of just doing less and relaxing more, carbs are the ""doing less and relaxing more"". So carbs plus rest = even more recovery. Again, I'm not saying high carb, what I'm saying is moderate cycled carbs. Very very big difference",1,2025-08-01 22:50:25

n69wag2,1mejljx,ethereal3xp,"From article

>After spending months without eating, drinking, or moving, hibernating mammals must rebound from extreme physiological changes. Two new studies suggest that the genetic “superpowers” underlying this incredible resilience may also be present in the human genome.

For these studies, published Thursday, July 31, in the journal Science, researchers at the University of Utah honed in on the specific DNA regions that help hibernators rapidly recover from muscle atrophy, insulin resistance, and brain damage. They found strong evidence to suggest that the human genome shares these genetic regions, which function as control switches for hibernator adaptations. Finding and harnessing them could lead to new treatments for type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and other disorders, the researchers say.

“Humans already have the genetic framework,” said Susan Steinwand, a neurobiology and anatomy researcher at U of U Health and first author of one of the studies. “We just need to identify the control switches for these hibernator traits.”

During hibernation, mammals enter a state of torpor, or physiological dormancy. This allows them to survive months without food and water, but at great cost to their health. Their muscles deteriorate due to lack of nutrition and movement, Christopher Gregg, a professor of neurobiology at U of U and senior author on both studies, told Gizmodo. Proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease build up in their brains, and upon awakening, the sudden reperfusion of blood can cause further neurological damage, he explained. What’s more, they become insulin resistant due to the amount of fat they gain to sustain them during months of starvation.

Hibernating mammals have evolved remarkable adaptations to reverse this extensive physiological damage. The genes that underlie these adaptations are likely also present in humans and other non-hibernators, Gregg explained. The fact that hibernation has evolved independently in multiple animal species suggests that its basic genetic ingredients are present across the mammalian genome. Therefore, non-hibernators may still carry them.

Finding these master switches in the mammalian genome is like searching for needles in a DNA haystack.",23,2025-08-01 03:38:16

n6epm9u,1mf5fup,Defiant_Honey_7231,"If you’re already on 1.5 IU of HGH a day, there’s not much point in adding Tesamorelin. HGH shuts down your body’s natural GH production through feedback loops, so Tesamorelin wouldn’t really have anywhere to act. It works by getting your pituitary to release its own GH, but if that system’s already suppressed, you’re basically throwing Tesamorelin at a closed door.

That said, some people think Tesamorelin might still help a little with visceral fat loss through other pathways, but it’s more speculative than proven. And honestly, it’s expensive for what would probably be a minimal benefit in that context.

If you were planning to stop HGH and wanted a more natural, long-term approach with less suppression risk, then Tesamorelin could make a lot of sense.",1,2025-08-01 21:54:16

I actually just started the creatine and rhodiola and I think I’ve already noticed a positive effect. My job is heavy duty manual labor, so I was missing my workouts because I felt so blasted by the time I got home. However 2 days of creatine/rhodiola I’m back to the weights

It’s neat to grow your own supps but my first action would have been to lab test the stuff I’m taking, then grow my own if I see I’m taking horsecrap. 1g is also a big dose, are you sure you need that much?",1,2025-08-01 03:03:06

Then 1, then 0.75, 0.50, 0.25, etc. Just eyeball it and cut them up with a knife. You won’t notice withdrawals this way. If you feel truly dependent on it, take this process as slow as you need to. 

The withdrawals truly do suck. I learned to cycle it a few times a year. 2 months on, 2 months off. Never take it for longer than two months at a time, and wean yourself off near the end of each bottle. I buy the lowest dose I can find (125mg).

I have put several people in my life onto them as well, and they have all been stoked with the results. I prefer to use it with the free mediation app but others don't, you can use it however you like.

I have come across a couple of people online who didn't like the acupressure mat but I think if you're intrigued, it is definitely worth trying at least. 

It takes a little getting used to but imo 100% worth it. Bizarrely enough I actually find getting off it the only painful part, but then again I often fall asleep on it so maybe that's why.

Bought it for helping/forcing me to ramp down before bed.

I found it very good for the intended purpose of inducing sleep, but with the caveat of waking up after 5-10 mins (to toss it on the floor) and end up pretty close to where I was before using it. I also never found it to have any impact or effect on the rest of that night's sleep.


The most biggest and best gamechanger for me was a Eye Mask. I put one on and it makes whatever plans my brain has irrelevant. If you don't have issues with something on your face (or the strap bothering you), there's a very good chance it'll change your life.",1,2025-08-01 17:11:17

n6e72tv,1mf19vi,kyzylkhum,"I would drop the ""esoteric"" ones like Tongkat Ali, Ashwaganda, Macaroot, Turmeric etc. Not that I think they don't work, but more like ""let's recover the natural potential thru what should have been there but is missing in the metabolism in the first place"" kind of approach makes more sense to me 

Vitamin E and D are quite good, I would still prioritize natural D from daily sun light exposure with measure and not take the E everyday, maybe couple of times in the first weeks and then once a week later on  

Maybe add in K2 MK4, there are studies showing it deals with excess estrogen and supports healthy testosterone production. MK4 is the only type of K2 that is found in the testicles, self explanatory. It synergizes with vitamin D as well, but maybe space out K and E, they are shown to act better separately 

Ditch the TRT crowd if you can increase your T naturally, it is known to cause testiculitis shrinkus and a whole host of imminent and prospective negative outcomes, and requires continuous professional attention, the industry gets you by the dear ones

Does it really matter to you if your “nuts are working”? I don’t understand why anyone gives a flying fuck. If you want a giant sack of nuts for some reason, get on clomid and probably arimidex so you don’t get man boobs.

n6e78uy,1mf19vi,Final_Frosting3582,"lol. 

Well, technically if someone is a type 2 they can respond to clomid and it will make their nuts start producing like mad. My big balls comment wasn’t a joke. I tried that route for about 1.5 years and had these enormous balls, 2000 ng/dl of test and NO performance increase whatsoever… but it literally stretched my nutsack for life (or so I think, because years later, I still have a saggy nutsack)

I can say with 100%  confidence that TRT is and entirely different (and better) solution, even if you respond on paper to clomid. I would NEVER take clomid again and risk gyno for absolutely no reason",2,2025-08-01 20:23:41

n6ea0gu,1mf19vi,Final_Frosting3582,"My thoughts on this subject are simple. If you use any supplement that messes with your hormones in order to chase exercise or sex performance, you should bite the bullet and do HRT. 

There’s no telling what all these supplements are doing to your body, there’s no real amount of control that you have, and your blood work and supplements will cost far more in one year than 10 year supply of test. 

It doesn’t matter what your test or free test says on paper, you absolutely will not get the results of TRT without TRT. And TRT can be insanely dialed in.

I don’t see any solid argument to fuck with your hormones “naturally”",2,2025-08-01 20:37:08

You are not alone, and while it’s not a solution for everyone, I’ve personally found that taking a few minutes to disconnect by meditating with 432 Hz music, or unwinding for a few minutes with cup of herbal tea (lemon balm, passion flower, or holy basil) can also be soothing. I have heard valerian root supplement in evenings can help with relaxation and regaining focus, but haven’t tried myself.

n6c5aif,1meoad2,grumble11,"You've burned out your reward system.  The solution is to stop screen use.  Delete YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.  Set the time limit function on your phone to one hour a day (that's enough for the tasks you actually need it for).

Here's how it works.  The brain seeks out reward.  Algorithmic screens are hyper-rewarding (superficially), optimizing to provide you with the maximum reward and engagement.  Your brain says 'oh great, massive dopamine hit, let's do this all day'.  You then do it all day, getting totally addicted to the algorithm.  Your brain's reward system is being over-stimulated all day long, so to achieve homeostasis it down-regulates.  Now normal life doesn't provide enough reward for your desensitized brain, and you experience symptoms akin to depression, anxiety and adhd-like symptoms.  Your executive function is totally shot.

The damage isn't mild either - heavy scrollers have had brain scans done and there is visible structural damage, similar to abusers of dopaminergic drugs.  Recovery for those drug users once they abstain takes time, and it doesn't get all the way better - they just learn to live with a blunted reward system.

If you stop now, you can limit the damage and your brain can significantly recover.

Also get more sleep, eat nourishing food, hydrate well, get some light exercise most days, and limit alcohol.  Good luck!",1,2025-08-01 14:15:31

For me, it’s ten minutes under my red-light therapy panel, dimmed room, screen free—does wonders for anxiety. The concept’s solid—different folks need different cues: maybe it’s a quick prayer, maybe some smooth jazz, maybe chewing whiskey-flavored gum. The key is picking one small, repeatable thing that says “okay, breathe,” and leaning on it whenever clutter or doomscrolling spirals.
