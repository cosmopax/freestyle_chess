1mf7mqe,"Im not fat, i'm just out of sync...",10,2,2025-08-01 22:40:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1mf7mqe/im_not_fat_im_just_out_of_sync/,"We’ve all heard it: “Calories in, calories out.”

I’ve been digging into something called **chrononutrition** (how the *timing* of your meals impacts metabolism). The idea isn’t new, but I want to know the biohackers' community experience/experimentation with it.

For those of you unaware, I'll quickly break it down:

A fun starting point:

* **Gasolone engine:** C₈H₁₈ (octane)+ O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + energy (heat)
* **Your body:** C₆H₁₂O₆ (glucose) + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + energy (ATP)

Similar, right? Both are combustion reactions. So in theory, weight loss should be simple: Burn more than you consume.

But here's where it gets weird: **your internal combustion engine is time-dependent.**

Mitochondrial function, insulin sensitivity, fat oxidation, enzyme activity...they *all* follow circadian rhythms. That means your body doesn’t metabolize food the same way at 8 a.m. as it does at 10 p.m.

And one of the most obvious studies I’ve come across is by Arble et al., 2009, published in *Obesity*.

Researchers took two groups of mice:

* Both groups were given **the same amount of food**, same macros, same everything.
* Group 1 was fed **only during the dark phase** (mice are nocturnal, so this is their *active* period).
* Group 2 was fed **only during the light phase** (their *rest* period).

**Result:**  
  
**Mice fed during their rest phase gained significantly more weight** than those fed during their active phase, even though calorie intake, macronutrient ratios, and activity levels were identical.

For those of you who object, *“****But I’m not a mouse!****”* Fair point, well made. Human studies show similar effects, just more difficult to control for confounding.

TL;DR:

Meal timing matters. Has anyone experimented with skipping dinner instead of breakfast? ",DrJ_Lume
1mehowk,Toning back my activity was the best decision I ever made,254,90,2025-08-01 02:03:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1mehowk/toning_back_my_activity_was_the_best_decision_i/,"You hear it all day the time in the fitness community…”over training isn’t real bro” “you can train 6x a week bro” “be active everyday or else you’re lazy” “sedentary lifestyle is a killer.”

For the last few months, I was lifting 4-5x a week with a couple of heavy boxing sessions a week and couldn’t figure out why my sleep, energy, libido/ED (as a 25m) were so bad; I wasn’t getting more than 5 hours of sleep and woke up 1-2x a night. My T levels came back at 230 & 375 or so.

The advice was to up my calories & carbs and in turn I just got more bloated and lethargic with constant cravings that made feel & look worse.

The last couple weeks I decided to just do normal stuff like go for walks with a friend, hang out in the pool/get some sun during work, play casual basketball, and keep lifting to 2x a week capped at 30 minutes.

I now sleep like a baby, look healthier/refreshed, my appetite is lower, have a ton of energy throughout the day with no crashes, and my body looks leaner and better. My libido/ED issue vanished completely too;. Currently eating low carb too since my activity level doesn’t command it but prioritizing lean meats & healthy fats with veggies.

I’m starting to think all this excessive activity that people recommend is a stressor on the body and isn’t ideal, at least for me. I also am intermediate in the gym in terms of strength but quite frankly okay giving all that progress up for the boost in QoL

Anyone experience the same?",vix_calls

A significant reduction in the thickness of the carotid artery intima-media and the size of the carotid plaque was observed. The improvement rates ranged from 66.5 to 95.4%.

1mes6en,Mood enhancers with ADHD,14,9,2025-08-01 11:45:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1mes6en/mood_enhancers_with_adhd/,"Hello everyone, I do take meds for adhd-pi right now. I do, however, occasionally experience depression symptoms. Hypersomnia (oversleeping) and anhedonia are the most common of these; anhedonia frequently results in a lack of motivation since it causes an unpleasant or dull mood. I'm searching for suggestions to improve my mood and sense of wellbeing; more drive and vitality would be wonderful, but it isn't my primary issue. At my boring part-time job, long shifts can be intolerable.

By far the most beneficial have been kratom and phenibut, particularly when used alongside my medications. I feel like they dumb me down and make me sluggish or overly carefree the day or days after dose, too, and I find it hard to take either in moderation. My libido is also killed by kratom. Other than these, I take ashwagandha, l theanine and moda from sportsresearch, ndepot and highstreetpharma but it gives me anxiety if I take for long.

not looking for the basics like diet, sleep, sun exposure, exercise, magnesium, zinc, tyrosine, etc, have most of these decently in check, although diet and sleep schedule could be improved a bit, as i mentioned oversleeping is an issue. racetams don't seem to do much for me (tried oxi, ani, phenyl, faso, prami). polygala makes me tired/foggy. was interested in bromantane, memantine, 9mebc, nsi 189, NA semax amidate, selank, sam-e, st johns wort. which of these, or any others that come to mind, work to boost mood/kill anhedonia without interfering with my meds, as combatting adhd is main priority due to being in university. not planning at beginning all these nootropics at once, to clarify. adderall works well for me, not looking to switch meds mid semester. i would also like to clarify that the anhedonia/low mood is NOT a result of adderall, as i've dealt with it since before being medicated. anhedonia may be slightly exacerbated but i don't believe that is the case. i do not fit the full diagnostic criteria for MDD, anhedonia is primary concern. i don't feel blue/sad/hopeless, more just dull or discontent. could also be a result of past kratom overuse/abuse, can go a couple months without using kratom, but eventually the dullness gets to me, i don't believe it is entirely a result of drug use tho. any suggestions appreciated, thank you. please let me know what has worked for yall, even if you don't have adhd/are medicated.",Griffincanon

1megpog,Why I stopped buying ashwagandha and started growing it myself,58,28,2025-08-01 01:19:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1megpog/why_i_stopped_buying_ashwagandha_and_started/,"Ashwagandha has been a part of my stack on and off for a few years. Mostly for stress, sleep, and general recovery. Like a lot of people here, I’m not expecting miracles but I always felt it helped me stay a little more level, especially during higher training volume or getting stressed at work.

But I started getting a bit more skeptical about the stuff I was taking regularly. You read enough studies and supplement reviews, and you start realizing how little consistency there can be between products. Extract ratios, fillers, standardization, quality control- even with decent brands, it’s hard to know exactly what you’re getting.

Not too knowledgeable about plants but I managed to grow some this year-

# What that looked like:

* I used Withania somnifera seeds (the actual species used in traditional and clinical settings). (Don't think I can discuss sources)
* Planted in early summer, in a big pot with sandy, well-draining soil.
* Got some info from plant care apps, the plant wants full sun and minimal water once it’s established, no fertilizers, no sprays, takes around 5–6 months to become ready for extract. Most recent one was with [Pipify](https://www.viralreach.org/apps/pipify?source=r_bh), did an ID to double check I had the correct plant, health scan to make sure it wasn't dying. I would deffo make sure you check in plant reddits or this one to make sure its legit as a final check.

By late autumn, the plant started yellowing and dying back- which is when you’re supposed to harvest. I pulled the root, cleaned it, chopped it into small pieces, and air-dried it over 10–14 days. Once dry, I ground it into powder with a basic coffee grinder and stored it in a glass jar. my haul yielded about 2 months worth of doses at 1g a day so if I want to do this long term Ill have to scale up my method.

# Why I prefer it now:

* I know exactly what’s in it. No maltodextrin, no capsules, no “sensoril blend” fluff. Just root.
* It’s surprisingly effective, even in small doses. I started with around 1mg in warm water before bed- tastes earthy but not awful.
* I noticed better sleep, less anxiety at night, and a more calm baseline during the day. Nothing crazy, just steady.
* There’s something grounding about using something you actually grew yourself. It becomes part of your system on another level. Hard to explain, but you feel more connected to your inputs.

# Is it more potent?

No idea. I didn’t lab test anything. But subjectively, it feels about the same as the better-quality capsules I used to take- maybe even a bit stronger. Could just be freshness or placebo. Doesn’t really matter to me. Let me know if you want me to do some testing and compare it to a brand (I think Janoshik does some?)

# Final thoughts

Obviously this won’t be for everyone. You need time, space, and patience. But if you're already into DIY, gardening, or just being more intentional about what you put in your body, it’s worth trying. It’s not just about saving money or being “natural” it’s about taking control of your inputs and closing the loop. Lost trust in a lot of these brands.

Would love to hear if anyone else here is growing their own herbs or adaptogens or if you’ve experimented with preparing your own nootropics from scratch (legal of course).

Happy to answer questions if you're thinking of trying it.

Let me know if you'd like a shorter version for a discussion thread or a more clinical rewrite if you're targeting a more research-focused crowd.",tsukitii

I have designed some protocols that combine supplements for maximal focus and cognition benefits.

Of course, without effective sleep and exercise, these supplements are far less effective. It is also important to note that everyone's biology is different, so variations are likely.

Resources Used: [OpenEvidence](https://www.openevidence.com), [Examine](https://examine.com), [Cochrane](https://www.cochranelibrary.com)

\-----

# Protocols

These protocols are designed around effective supplement stacking for varied cognitive and focus enhancements

**Executive Function Morning Enhancement**

Alpha-GPC supplies readily available choline to raise acetylcholine, caffeine provides alertness, L-theanine steadies the stimulation, and DHA stabilises neuronal membranes, so the choline signal is put to good use. The combo delivers crisp verbal fluency and decision-making within 45 minutes and stays smooth for several hours.

Upon waking, take 300 mg Alpha-GPC and 100 mg caffeine + 200 mg L-theanine, then have 1 g DHA/EPA with breakfast.

**Neuroplasticity Growth Cycle**

Lion’s Mane and Bacopa promote NGF and synaptogenesis; creatine supplies the ATP needed for new-synapse formation, while B12 ensures efficient one-carbon metabolism crucial for myelin and neurotransmitter synthesis. The quartet supports faster learning curves and creative problem-solving over time.

For a three-month cycle, combine 1,000 mg Lion’s Mane and 320 mg Bacopa monnieri in the morning, with 8 g creatine and 500 µg vitamin B12 at lunch.

**Sleep-Aid Cognition Support**

Mg-Threonate and L-theanine deepen slow-wave and REM cycles, while saffron’s crocins modulate GABAergic tone and have produced MMSE gains in mild cognitive impairment trials. Better sleep architecture translates directly into next-day executive function.

One hour before bed, take: - 1,000 mg magnesium L-threonate and 200 mg L-theanine. With dinner, add 30 mg saffron extract

1mewaqq,First 3 days on Rhodiola (N = 1),3,3,2025-08-01 15:19:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1mewaqq/first_3_days_on_rhodiola_n_1/,"I know, it is a non-randomized experiment, no control, etc, could be a placebo but here is what I can report after 3 days of taking Rhodiola (250mg) in the morning:

**1. Massive relaxation**

This is not the effect I was expecting. I started taking it to improve physical/mental performance. But I was also stressed out - during the week before taking it I slept on average 2-3 hour per night. I had anxiety.

What I feel now is calmness, serenity. No euphoria, just calmness. I haven't felt like this in many, many years. This is the most drastic effect of a supplement I have ever seen - and I have been experimenting for nearly 10 years.

I feel not worried at all and optimistic about life. I feel younger (I am 50).

It is a very striking effect which I started experiencing after only 1 or 2 days of Rhodiola intake. As it continues for two days in a row I have no doubts that it is the Rhodiola as everything else is the same.

I feel so calm that last night I did not take the sleep medications I have been taking for the last 2 months and still had solid 6 hours of sleep.

**2. More stamina**

I have been doing light jogging for an hour. My speed is a notch higher but I feel that I can exert myself more - I maintain a higher HR.

The above is the good part. Now the not so good one:

**3. Less focus**

I have been too relaxed. I am generally suffering from a light ADHD so tend to procrastinate but over the last year I have been managing very well with the combo of modafinil and pyracetam. It gives me lazer-like focus and energy to work. I did not stop taking them but I don't feel their impact anymore. I did noticeably less work over the last 2 days. I spent more time on social networks, reading the news, Nothing excessive but it adds up. But the biggest drop in productivity was due to just chillaxing and feeling blissful.

So I am not so sure what to make out of this. I will probably stop or reduce the intake of Rhodiola as the negative part is serious enough to matter. But I still wanted to share my experience as it's singularly the most powerful and quick effect of a nootropic that I have ever experienced. OK, maybe modafinil comes close to it. Also, some years ago I was depressed and back then prozac had a similarly drastic effect but it wasn't as quick to manifest itself - it took a week or even longer for me to feel the difference.

So there it is - make of this whatever you want. YMMV.",NotaADwarf
